Title: Ant Foraging Behaviour simulation
Course: Computational Biology 2024

Sueprvisor: Kamiel Debeuckelaere

For this course, two models were built to simulate ant foraging behaviour with and without pheromones. The models are annotated to explain the purpose of each line of code.
The folder structure is explained below:

CompBio_foraging_ants.dockx: This file contains the description of the project as provided by our supervisor.
Code: This is the main folder, containing all models, tests, statistical scripts, gifs of the animations, datasets and figures.
Code/Dataset: This folder contains all the datasets that were generated after each simulation and used in RStudio for visualization and statistics.
Code/Figures: This folder contains all the figures generated in R, of which some were used in the final report.
Code/Final models: This folder contains the two final models: one with and one without pheromones.
Code/Gifs: This folder contains all the GIFs that were generated from the animation in the models.
Code/Model_tests: This folder contains a framework we devised in the beginning as well as the first two test models. These were not used later on, for the complete models please refer to the folder 'Final models'
Code/Statistics: This folder contains the R scripts that were used for data visualization and statitical analysis of all simulations.
Code/ffmpeg: This folder is the intallation folder of ffmpeg which was needed for generating GIFs, does not contain anything relevant to the project.
